          <p class="font-bold">
            Never consume any wild mushroom unless you are 100% certain of its identification and edibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Misidentification of mushrooms can result in severe illness, organ damage, or death. The information on this website is not sufficient to safely identify edible mushrooms.

        <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          MushroomWise.org is an educational resource dedicated to sharing information about mushrooms and fungi. All content, including identification guides, cultivation information, and educational materials, is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
        </p>

        <h2>Not Medical or Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>
          The information contained on this website is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of qualified professionals regarding any questions you may have about mushroom identification, foraging, consumption, or cultivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not provide medical advice related to mushroom consumption, poisoning, or therapeutic use. If you suspect mushroom poisoning, contact your local poison control center or emergency services immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>
          While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The science of mycology is constantly evolving, and taxonomy, identification features, and edibility status of mushrooms may change over time. Information that was accurate when published may become outdated.
        </p>

        <h2>Mushroom Identification Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Proper mushroom identification requires examination of multiple features, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Macroscopic features (cap, gills, stem, color, texture)</li>
          <li>Microscopic features (spore size, shape, and color)</li>
          <li>Chemical reactions (with specific reagents)</li>
          <li>Habitat and geographic considerations</li>
          <li>Season and growth conditions</li>
          <li>Smell and taste (by experts only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Digital photography and descriptions cannot capture all necessary features for definitive identification. Many mushrooms have toxic lookalikes that can be easily confused with edible species.
        </p>

        <h2>Foraging Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          If you choose to forage for mushrooms, we strongly recommend the following safety practices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn from experienced foragers in person</li>
          <li>Use multiple field guides and identification resources</li>
          <li>Consult with local mycological societies</li>
          <li>Start with easily identifiable species with few dangerous lookalikes</li>
          <li>Only harvest mushrooms you can identify with 100% certainty</li>
          <li>When in doubt, throw it out</li>
          <li>Always save a specimen of any mushroom you intend to consume</li>
          <li>Try only a small amount of a new-to-you edible mushroom first time</li>
        </ul>
